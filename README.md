### Hi ðŸ‘‹ Michaela Wagner here.
I'm a self-taught Fullstack Developer with three years of professional experience who is always eager to learn new things and grow as developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Zions Bancorporation, working on [Treasury Gateway](https://digital.zionsbank.com/web/zions-first-national-bank), their business banking portal. 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript, GraphQL, and React Native for fun because I'd love to work with those sooner, rather than later. I am also very interested in AI, its nuances and implications for society

- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to write in Elvish Tengwar when I was 12.
